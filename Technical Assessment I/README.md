# Arithmetic Sequence Generator
by Natanael Jansudin Siregar (https://www.natanaelsiregar.me/)

This Python project provides a class to generate an arithmetic sequence and display it as a string. It accepts a user input specifying the number of terms and outputs the arithmetic sequence.

## Features

- **Arithmetic Sequence Generation:** Generates an arithmetic sequence using the first term and the common difference.
- **Customizable Parameters:** By default, the sequence starts from 2 with a common difference of 3. These can be customized if needed.
